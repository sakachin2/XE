            off     :No change id is added.
                  on/off is not effective after the file is closed.
            clear   :Clear all tag added before current edit.
                     Current updated line is tagged when saved
                     if CID on.
                     For <a href="HID00000238.htm">margined</a> file,CID is searched in the range
                     specified on CID header line. If CID position is
                     Left margin,it is searched in Left margin only.

                     column position is specified on <a href="HID00000209.htm">INI file</a>
                     Change_ID_Type_xx parameter.
                     Change is effective for only updated line after
                     option changed,you can use this option to arrange
                     CID column of all line with it.
                     If that position is occupied by data,CID follow
                     after the end of data.
                     The position can be specified on CID HEADER.
                     For margined file,CID is searched in the range
                     specified on CID header line.
                     And,it is not shifted when the pos is occupied by
                     data for Left margin CID file.
            defon   :CID is set by default when you do not explicitly
                     set on/off by this command(this is default)
            defoff  :No CID is set by default when you do not explicitly
                     set on/off.
                  defon/defoff status is saved and effective in the next session.

                     ___ is any string. By puting file xe_top.xxx on

                     fld,topk is for COBOL with space num field,

                     (Note) line cmd &quot;AC&quot;/&quot;BC&quot;(After/Before) is used to copy CID for each copy operation.

                     CID header line is re-evaluated and update on CID

                      HEADER specification on the first line.
                      With clear/shift,specified type of CID is cleared/
                      shifted. The CID type of the file is not replaced.
                      (Without CID type,clear/shift select current CID
                       type of the file. If the file has CID HEADER,
                       CID type of the file is replaced by CID HEADER.
                       then clear/shift operation is done.
                       If file has no CID HEADER or deleted,

                     If CID type is date, append if date is changed.
                     This is effective only if CID position is not fixed by CID header line.
                     Specify with on/off/defon/defoff.
                     &quot;(def)off APPEND&quot; resets APPEND status only,
