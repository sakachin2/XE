                  You can use ICU/iconv converter by EBCDIC cfg file prepared.
                  If you do not use the EBCDIC cfg file, you can specify CP037, CP939, or CP930.
                  If you do not specify this converter option, the converter in the cfg file is used.
                  If no cfg file is prepared, the default is CP930 in Japanese environments, and CP037 otherwise.

              CPxx option is save to profile.
              No need to specify for the 2nd open.
              Default is CPAS, and CPxx option for the directory is default of the file in the directory.
              You can confirm the open option by the id *U/*u/*L/*l/*b on the header filename line.
              (&quot;b&quot; means binary mode open.)
              Uppercase means explicit CPxx specification including the case by saved value in the profile.
              Re-load by CPLC when translation error if no CPU8 option or CPU8 is not registered on profile.
              UTF cmd can change the default and CPLC reload option.

                  To force open, use &quot;IE&quot; option.
                  Not translated code are loaded as it is and displayed by &quot;?&quot;.
                  You can open by browse mode even if translation error occured.
                  Error position is searched by &quot;f *ec&quot; cmd.
            FNU8|FNLC|FNAS:Specify dirlist filename encoding.
            (Linux)
                  Specify dirlist filename encoding if valid on both encoding.
                  It is recorded to profile, so use FNAS to reset it.
                  Also available to file to be opened.
            (Windows)
                  Windows use UTF-16 for filename encoding, so FNxx will be ignored.
                  xe display by locale code if utf16--&gt;locale code translation succeeded,
                  else display by unicode with color green.

                            Text mode write by w=T translate 0x0a to 0x0d0a on Windows.
                            For ex, if /Mpt is specified, single 0x0a is not EOL-ID
                            but it is new EOL-ID at next open after saved.
                     (Note) &quot;ET&quot; cmd check 0x15 as EOL character for EBCDIC file.
                            On the other hands, /Mt recognize 0x0a and 0x0d0a as EOL character.
                            If you cannot open the file due to a header error
                            because the file is recorded as variable length mode in the profile, open it with /Mt.

              M:Mac  mode  :0x0d   is line delimitter.
              E:EBCDIC mode:0x15   is line delimiter.

              line eol is 0x0a, &quot;p&quot; if 0d0a.
              Default is /muu for /mu,/mtp for /mt when only &quot;r&quot; is
              specified.
              If r!=w, EOL char is changed and written when save or close
              file even if no line updated.

              &quot;width&quot; is initial display width. If line is long over the
              value it is displayed as concatenated line.
              When line contains TAB(0x09) ,those lines are expanded over the
              width by TAB expansion(See <A href="HID00000319.htm">TAB</A> cmd).
