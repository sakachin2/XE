                     Update is enabled when restart xe,
                     or enabled if "refresh" after saved.
                     Format of the line of definition file is "Shortcut-pathname fullpath-name".
                     Put "#" at top of line to comment out.
                     e.g.) srctest1 d:\eclipse-workspace\testproject1\src\com\debug\test
                           ecws  "c:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\gradle"
            refresh: reload  definition file of ::xe.shortpath.
                     Use after "sp edit", modify then saved or directly updated ::xe.shortpath by
                     another process.
            add    : add a line to definition file by sp-name:Shortcut pathname and file-spec:shortcut target fullpath name.
                     This definition is enabled instantly.
                     Following specifications are effective at proper situation.
                       *\ :the file currently opened on this panel.
                       ^*\:the file currently opened on another split panel.
                     e.g.) sp add srctest1 d:\eclipse-workspace\testproject1\src\com\debug\test
                           sp add ecws  "c:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\gradle"
        .To utilize Shortcut pathname, add prefix "sp:" to file-spec.
         (If xxx of sp:xxx is not defined, "sp:xxx" is used as is.)
           e.g.) e sp:srctest1\Main.java
                 e sp:ecws
                 e "sp:ecws\space embedded name"
                 xcopy sp:ecdir\x1 sp.ecdir\x2
                 cd sp:ecdir

#ifdef Axe (Android版)

          If you specify "//" for sp-name, you can access the folders on Shared storage.
          "sp add //" will display a android dialog,
          When you press "Use this folder", the specified folder is registered in the definition file (::xe.shortpath).
          After that, you can access files in that folder like as "e //folder name".
          In that dialog you can also create a new folder,
          for example, if you create a folder named "Axe" and press "Use this folder",
          "e //Axe" displays the directory list.
          Android 11 or later.
            On Android 11 or later, you can set permission of access "All files" or "Media only" in Shared storage.
            Please answer which permission setting you want in the dialog that appears immediately after installing this App.
            Even if you did not select "All files" here, it can be changed from the menu, "Settings", "Android related".
            If you select "all files",
              As the path name of the Shared storage is displayed in the "Android related" dialog
              you can also use the pathname directly.
              If the /sdcard pathname whown in the dialog is the same as the Shared storage pathname
              /sdcard is also available as pathname.
              You can also use short names for parameters of command line tools such as grep, xfg on the =6 screen.
              e.g) "gre findWord //Axe/*.txt".
