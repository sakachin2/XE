         S : set to the command input line of the command history panel.
         t : set on the other panel if screen is split.

       -COL command (Display column gauge to enable setting of tab stop position)
        .COL [on|off] [ALL|type|default]
        .It can be used also on directory list panel.
        .On directory list, "COL on type" sets default gauge type for all member of the directory.
         "COL off" resets it. You have to prepare following gauge file in work directory.
           (Win) ::xe!col!.type (Linux) ::xe_col_.type
        .When Col type is set to a directory, use COL command for each members to set different option.
           "COL [on|off] [type|default]"
              default:display default gauge for the member file.
                      This option is not for directory but file.
              on     :follows directory setting if new type is not specified.
              off    :hide gauge and reset type for the file,
                      and next "COL on" refers directory setting.

     (129T)
       -Syntax Highlight.
        Supports ANSI:reverse attributes of Andre Simon's Highlight and GNU source-highlight.
        Also, by specifying C_UNDERLINE=R/G_UNDERLINE=R in xesynl.cfg/::xesynl.cfg,
        you can get reverse effect for underline attribute.
       -Unicode support for CID prefix.
        U-235d(&#9053;) is a comment prefix in APL language, CID supports it.
        You can also set the extensions to apply by specifying the following in the ::xe.ini file:
          Change_ID_Type_4 = 60 = u-235d= APL
        With this setting, you can specify APL by CID type like as &quot;CID on APL&quot;
        When using Unicode, the display width varies depending on the language environment,
        so be careful when sharing the file.
        For example, if Windows displays by 2 columns and Linux displays 1 column,
        the CID tagged to the update line on Windows is not recognized as CID on Linux.
        So the &quot;cid clear&quot; command on Linux may return 0 rows.
