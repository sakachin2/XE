        or Ctrl+P (print file), the session may crash because printing is in progress.
       -Correct to display of combining/formatting characters in UTF8 files.
        Especially in Windows, combining characters are displayed differently
        between Windows Terminal and Conhost(previous terminal emulator).
       -Handles /Ffontname both name of English and Regional Language.

     2.Additional function.
       -(Linux) Added the 'W' option to use the API:wcwidth() to get cell width
        for characters of ambiguous display widths.
        Cmd line option:-G{Y|N|W}[0|1|2|y|w], Defaults is /GWw.
       -Directory List.
        Displays the free space percentage for the line of drive(Windows) and mount point(Linux).
        The % is updated by session restart(Windows) or Refresh:Shift+F1(Linux).
        (Linux) When you switch to Username display mode with Shift+F6,
        the device name (/dev/sdaa, etc.) is displayed.
       -LOCate command, additional options.
        ex) loc {insall|repall} xxx
        Copies the label from the labeled command line (.yyy) to the current text line.
        ex)Copy (repall) or insert (insall) the string xxx.yyy to the top of the lines.

         ./G{Y|N}{y|0|1|2}
            :Specy cell width of unicode defined width is ambiguous.
            Y:Fit to font width.
              You can also specify the second option for chars in unfamiliar languages.
              However, this option takes a cost, the start-up will be slightly slower.
            N: Specify the display width uniformly using the second option.
            The default value is /GY2.
            Ex.) /GN2: All ambiguous chars are displayed in two cells.

                 /GY0: Unfamiliar languages are displayed as ':;' instead.

            when running on Linux, on gnome-terminal, konsole, etc.,

            But if it fails, specify this option.
            Use font_param_filename when specifying indirectly from a file, use font_param_filename.
            See Microsoft's documentation for the appropriate charset for the font.
            Ex.) /F"MS Mincho":128, /F@.\fontParm.txt.

       -XBC command supports ucs4<-->utf16 conversion.
            Ex.) xbc 1f468/s    ==> x1f468/s:=d83ddc68

       -"-cont" option added to Find command.
          When selecting lines in a large file by the Find command in the Exe cmd file,
          from a performance consideration,
          when NotFound occurred, the next Find will start not from the first line,
          but from the last Found line.
          It will be better on condition that files were sorted.
