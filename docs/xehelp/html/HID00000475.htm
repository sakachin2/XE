     1.BUGs

     2.Additional function.
       -Display file description on dir-list panel.
        .Toggle this function by Shift+F10
        .EDIt/BROwse command option /Md set On at dir open.(&quot;e dir1 /Md&quot;)
        .if On,display max 48 byte.
        .&quot;description&quot; is gotten as following.
         For Windows version,read from top of stream named &quot;xe-desc&quot;.
         This &quot;stream&quot; is one of ADS(Alternative Data Stream) of NTFS.
         &quot;:&quot;+47 byte stream is displayed.
         When &quot;xe-desc&quot; is not set up or for other than Windows version,
         read top 1024 byte of the file itself.
         If &quot;:DID&quot; is contained in the range of 1024 byte,display
         from the next of &quot;:DID&quot; string to the EndOfLine.
         If no &quot;DID:&quot; found,display from top to EndOfLine of 1st not null line
         of the file. Control char(&lt;0x20) is replaced by &quot;.&quot;.

        (Note) ADS.
               NTFS supports multiple data stream attached to each file/dir.
               Accessed by naming convention of fil-name:stream-name,
               echo command will create stream like as
               echo &quot;text&quot; &gt; abc.ext:stream1 (1 byte base name may be error)
               dir command or explorer cannot display stream.
               cat command if you have display the stream contents like as
               cat abc.ext:stream1.
               To delete ADS(ADS size cannot be reduced) copy the file to
               not NTFS volume then CopyBack after deleted the file.
       -Horizontal scrolling.
        .When scroll lock is on,Left/Right arrow key scroll file contents
         screen by one column.
         Up/Down arrow key also scroll a line when scroll lock is on.
         This dose not work for Linux Console version.
        .GUI version(wxe,gxe) supports mouse with horizontal scroll function,
         It scrolls screen by the column specified on Setup dialog panel.
         I experienced 2 type of horizontal scroll mouse.
         Tilt wheel mouse generates WM_HSCROLL mouse message,
         another generates VK_SCROLL then VK_LEFT/VK_RIGHT keyboard message.
         wxe support both,but gxe support support VK_SCROLL type only.
         Keyboard message type dose not generate VK_SCROLL when already
         ScrollLock is on,so that shifts 1 column under that condition.
        .To scroll horizontally using simple wheel mouse,use Shift+wheel.
         Ctrl+wheel is used to jump to top/last page of file.
         These two function is supported also by Linux console version.
       -(WXE)Forward/Backword button click of 5 button mouse is treated
        as DPU/DPD(FilePath Up/Down) command.
       -LOCate cmd.
        .search labeled line by .label operand spcification.
       -Fix keyboad input to uppercase.
        .New command CAP.
          CAP [ON|OFF] [TSO|DEFAULT|CMD]
          Default is set for each TSO file and the others.
          If operand missing on file opened panel,toggles the status of the file.
          CMD means that CAP-ON is effective also on the command-input-line.
        .Use Shift-key when input lowercase letter when CAP ON.
         (Linux console version cannot detect Shift-key,so CAP-ON reverse
          upper and lower. The effect is not same as other version when
          keyboard CapsLock is on)
        .New CAP option of EDIt command set CAP ON status at open.
        .New edit line command &quot;U&quot; support upper-case translation.
          Ur,b.s or UU-UU,b.s format.
       -Setup &quot;Line Drawing Character&quot; by the ini file.
        .As a default,some code are assigned for line drawing character.
         Those are of Japanese DOS under Japanese environment.
         Or else,ECS(IBM PC Extended Character Set) is used as known as CP437.
         Hex code is displayed on =0.2 panel.
        .Code assignment is changed by the file on work directory.
         Naming convention is xelch__.ini[.locale]
           __ : version ID ex) win,gcc,wxe,lnx,gtk.
           locale: for Linux version (lnx and gtk) only.  ex) &quot;ja_JP.eucJP&quot;
                   It is gotten by Linux &quot;locale&quot; command.
           The filename is displayed on the bottom line of =0.2 panel.
        .OPT LINECH [on |off |filename | reload]
       -SUBmit command.
        .Support input redirect specification(&quot;&lt;stdinfile&quot;).
         To avoid hung by unexpected stdin read operation issued by
         submitted shell/exe, &quot;&lt;NUL&quot;(/dev/null for UNX) is appended
         in those case.
        .For 1st operand(script/exe filename),to make use of PTH
         environment variable fullpath conversion is applyed only
         when path is partialy specified.
         Special path specification format *\ , ^*\ , :: is available.
        .For 2st parameter only,support &quot;*&quot; specification.
         That is replaced by currently opened file name.
         ex) &quot;SUB subtool *&quot;.
         (&quot;*&quot; of 1st operand means execution of the current file.)
         This is for the convenience of passing file to other script/exe.
         If the file is updated by edit operation,the contents are
         save to a temporary file and the temporary file name is passed
         to the 1st operand file. This is for the convenience of
         repeated submit with partialy modification.
        .Treat &quot;**&quot; as orginal filename specification regardless of
         update of the file.
         ex) &quot;SUB subtool * ** p1&quot; , &quot;SUB ** p1&quot;
       -(Win) Turnkey MVS support.
        &quot;Turnkey MVS&quot; is MVSR38J on PC(&quot;Hercules&quot; emulates 370 instruction).
        It is able to access TSO file on Turnkey MVS using IND$FILE
        through 3270 emulator.
        It is supported to display PDS members.
        About detail,see the session &quot;Turnkey MVS support&quot; in the chapter
        &quot;(0)Introduction-(D)How to for&quot;.
       -Edit command
        .New option Fn[-m] to force the record length to n and set
         left margin to m.
        .New TC|NOTC option to specify TAB clear(change to space at save).
       -B2A/A2B(EBCDIC&lt;==&gt;ASCII) conversion option is added.
        (Ignore 0x0e/0x0f as SO/SI of SBCS(Japanese DBCS))
       -Change command.
        IC(CaseInsensitive) and ICN(CaseInSensitive,change displayed line only)
        commands are added.

     3.Miscellaneous.
       -INI command skip Japanese comment output on ini file
       -For delete edit-line-command only,remove limit of repeat count 9999.
       -Reset edit line command differently for label and the other cmds.
        Esc key twice or &quot;RESet&quot; clear line cmd except label,
        Esc key three times or &quot;RESet L&quot; clear label cmd.
       -Assign also Alt+'=' to Vertical-Line as same as Alt+'^'.
        '=' on english 101 keyboard correspond to '^' on 106
        Japanese keyboard.
       -Separately save scroll value for the parameter setting(=0.1/2/3) panel.
       -On the screen of =0.2 command verb can be cahnged for the function
        for which function-key cannot be assigned except Edit/Browse/Select.
       -Windows Vista support.(Test by RC1 English version)
        .Correspond memory management logic change.
         (xe terminate with msg &quot;address xxxx is not malloced&quot;)
        .WinHelp is deprecated.
         Changed to call associated application(browser:IE) and
         to call HtmlHelp for popup help.
         (Previously wxe.hlp was not able to read under English environment)
        .Default charset is changed to use windows default.
         Previously default was ShiftJIS(for Japanese user).
       -(WIN/LNX)Also console version,help command kicks browser.
       -Keep old SPF version number on the line number field of valid
        SPF line even when the line was changed by RENUM command.
        Previously renum-ed lines of error SPF file(contains short or
        invalid line number line) ware changed it version number to
        the largest one.

        Search the word on cursor position,and continue to search same word as long as pressing these key.
        Once intercepted by other key, new word is selcted from the cursor position.
        Following cmd verb is assinged for each, FWB,FWF,IWB,IWF.
        And you can specify word delimiter type on cmd line(from the first if function key is used).

          AN | SP | DQ | SQ | (x | x( | )x | x)

          AN:all puctuation(Default), SP:space, DQ:&quot;(double quotation), SQ:'(single quotation)

          ) :right boundary,  )x excluding  x and x) including x.
             If &quot;(&quot; or &quot;)&quot; is delimiter,specify like as \((, \)(, \(), \)).
             If '&quot;' is delimiter specify like as &quot;&quot;(.
             AN dose not contains @, _, $ and locale specific as punctuation character.
             x may be multibyte string.
        If the cursor is on the reversed range by mouse drag or Cut&amp;Paste function key,
        the whole string in the range is searched.
        If cursor is out of file contents area such as cmd line or lineno field,
        serach the same word as previously selected.
        This allow to search in the other file in the same session.
        The word is save for next session(max 128 byte).

            @parmfile :Repeat for each line of the parmfile.
            S         :S means select and used on the dir-list panel.
                       Each filename(with out path) corresponding to the wildcard is the last parameter to the EXE cmd.
            wildcard  :Without &quot;S&quot;,fullpath name corresponding to the wildcard is the last parameter
                       of each repetation.
            D[+]      :By default,sub dir is not selected.
                       D : select directory entry only, D+:select all entry including directory.
          One supposed usage is change the word in all files in the directory at once.
            ex) File execmdf contains following 3 lines.
                       s &quot;%3&quot;

                Enter  &quot;exe ! execmdf FROM TO &lt;s *.c&quot; on dir-list panel.
                EXE cmd executes Select/Change/End to all *.c file in this directory.
                If &quot;!&quot; is not specified,repetation stop at the file which dose not contains the word FROM.
                To abridge cmd input,you may register this exe cmd in =0.1 panel.
                For ex,enter &quot;chd exe ! execmdf %1 %2 &lt;s *.c&quot; on =0.1 panel.
                &quot;chd FROM TO&quot; on cmd line do the same thing.
          When setupping EXE cmd file,you should consider that file name may have embedding space.

            DBCSspace_dispchar=FF #(FF)# DBCS space display char. (FF means U-2591)
        . "tab on 000" is used to back to default(u21be-21c0,2591) or INI settings.
        . ex)  tab on "^-" ,   tab on u25b8-25b9 ,  tab on "^-!" ,  tab on u25b8-25b9-21be.
        . When Non-ASCII is specified as altch, "xpr -tabon" cmd use the altch
          for printing CPU8 file and use 0x18 and 0x1a for non-CPU8 file.
