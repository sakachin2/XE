        If you use "sshfs" to mount remote files,                     
        you can access remote more easily than using xehosts as shown below.
        However, it seems that development of sshfs has ended.       
        Instead, there is rclone.

      .UNC notation is available between Windows for shared files.

       ex). \\server/ip-addr\shared-folder\...\file-name
            If password required to login, use explorer or
            net use \\server command.
            ex) net use \\server1\folder1 password /user:domainname\userid
       WindoswXP configuration has IdleTimeout(Default 15 min) and
       maximum logon user count(XP-Home:5, XP-Pro:10),
       confirm it by &quot;net config server&quot; cmd.
       Timeout can be set by &quot;&quot;net config server /autodisconnect:&quot; cmd.
       Network search may be cause of delays of getting file.
       To check server name use &quot;net view&quot; cmd.
       &quot;net view \\server&quot; lists shared folders.

       Try to inactivate WebClient service if connection time is too long.
       (I do not know why but this dose not occur if share-name is 1 byte drive letter)
       If WebClient is active, Windows try to use HTTP port(80).
       Under the condition of server firewall deny the request,
       long time-out-delay takes place.
       (To invalidate WebClient service,
          ControlPnel--&gt;Management--&gt;Service, Select WebClient and set invalid.)
       You may set accept/reject port:80 on server side to avoid timeout wait.

       Special treatment to UNC notation.
         All UNC format has psuedo drive &quot;\:&quot;.
         You can set current-drive and current-path by CD cmd or &quot;.&quot; line cmd
         on dir-list.
         e.g) After &quot;cd <a href="file://server/dir">\\server\dir</a>&quot;,
              \:abc is \\server\dir\abc, \:\abc is <a href="file://server/abc">\\server\abc</a>.
              After \: if once CD setting completed,
              (&quot;.&quot; line cmd set both current drive and path)
              xyz is \\server\dir\xyz.
         Current-drive is not saved, but
         current-dir setting for \: is saved and effective on the next session.
         /R cmdline option recovers current drive for also drive &quot;\:&quot;.

         Undoable delete dir-list line cmd(&quot;d&quot; and &quot;/&quot;) renames the file
         at the remote dir for later undo operation if &quot;OPT UNDEL&quot; is on.
         Actual deletion takes place at session termination.

     Followings are about remote access to Unx from Windows/Unx.

      .Access remote file by remoteID registered on hosts file.
       Default hosts fiel is xehosts on <a href="HID00000236.htm">work directory</a>(::xehosts).
       ex). edit file1.txt in home dir on 192.168.2.15 by &quot;e a1:file1.txt&quot;
            with hosts file has following line
         a1 192.168.2.15  user001 pswdpswd

    #ifdef LNX

        For the case you have no privilege to mount shared resource,
        register remote (Samba or Windows) server in ::xehosts.
          ex)  &quot;w764  192.168.8.22 usrskt pswd  share=sharename
        share parameter means to use smbclient(Linux version)/JCIFS(Android version)  to access the remote system.
        Android version's NODe cmd without password option is used for asynchronous connection test.
          NODe hodtID
        Samba is faster than FTP.
        At first confirm connectablility to Samba Server by
          smbclient -L hostname hostname: ip-address or name on /etc/hosts
        Check ::xeftplog if it dose not work.
        ::xeftplog is written by &quot;xe -ftpw&quot; cmd.

    #endif //LNX

      .password in the line is encrypt if edit and saved by xe.
       For more safety, use NODe cmd to set volatile password
       which is not saved to ::xehost and effective in the session.
         NODe host-ID password (ex. &quot;nod ftpsvr1 CabZyx&quot;)
      .<a href="HID00000378.htm">undo</a> line cmd of dirlist is not yet supported except for TSO.
      .Use Samba(smbclient) to access Windows from Linux.
       (Register the host on xehost with SHARE= parameter.)
       OR
         mount Windows share like as
           mkdir /WinDriveE
           mount -t cifs //192.168.1.12/E /WinDriveE -o username=yourname
         Now you can access Windows share name by &quot;xe /WinDriveE&quot;
      .<a href="HID00000317.htm">SUBmit cmd</a> for remote file is executed locally except <A href="HID_TSOE_E.htm">TSO file</A>.

                          default is &quot;dir&quot;. use this option when FTP server dose not support dir subcmd.
                          LS=NLST means LS=&quot;ls -la&quot;.

    (Note) Because using ftp to access remote, proper environment setup is required.
           DNS may cause slow response because xe open session each access.
           To avoid DNS reference, register your local address on remote /etc/hosts.
           And confirm resolve sequence of /etc/host.conf is host then DNS
           like as &quot;order hosts,bind&quot;.

          .PSFTP of puTTY. (SSH2 was tested under v063)
            Followings are additional option for PSFTP.

            #@PSFTP=g:\src\putty060\psftp.exe
                Use when psftp is not on PATH environment variable.
                Additional option will be specified. Default is shown on ::xeftplog.
                (::xeftplog is written when xe starts with -fw command line option)
            #@SSH=all
                Set ssh=Y as default for the destination after this line.
            dest1 192.168.2.5  user pswd  ssh=Y
                Specify ssh=Y(use PSFTP) or ssh=N(use FTP) for each destination.
                If missing, #@SSH= is applied as default.
          (Note)
            .Specify like as ##@PSFTP=... to comment out.
            .At first SSH connection to the destination, use native psftp command on console window
             to save host-key in cache.(ex. psftp -l USER -pw PSWD)
             (You may be requested reply of &quot;yes/no&quot; to cache SSH key, it could not reply from xe)
             -xe use -batch option of psftp, but Windows version will hang up if no host-key
              is in cache. Linux version end with error, so xe display the error reason.
            .psftp current version dose not display slink information on dir-list.
            .::xehost update is effective from the next session.
