            .Use function key(F5/Shift+F5) to re-search same word.
             Searching re-start from top/bottom when same function key is
             hit after reached to bottom/top.

             case insensitive search(F5) or case insensitive reverse
             search(Shift+F5).If command verb(only abrigement is allowed)
             is also input,case sensitivity depend on the command verb.
            .Tab and its following space is assumed same as space char.

              . Ctrl+F5 (re)find using PSP cmd, Alt+F5 (re)find using PSF cmd.
                Ctrl+Shift+F5, Alt+Shift+F5 switches search direction.
                If find cmd operand is set on cmd line,
                PSP/-PSF option is selected from cmd line regardress function key used(F5, C+F5 or A+F5).
                PSF cmd saved is lost when the file is closed.
                Latest two PSP cmds saved are recovered at restart as for SPLIT(1) and SPLIT(2).
              . On Linux, Alt+F5 may be assinged as default shortcut key.
                Inactivate it by Linux Settings--&gt;Shortcut, chnage Function-Key assignmeny on xe =0.2 panel.

              . This function enable 3 pattern's search on a file.
                After followings

                  F abcP -psp
                  F abcF -psf
                F5 searches &quot;abcS&quot;, Ctrl+F5 searches &quot;abcP&quot; and Alt+F5 searches &quot;abcF&quot;.
                To continue search same pattern, use same key.
                (ex) &quot;F abcP -psp&quot;, C+F5, C+F5, S+C+F5
              . Change cmd is not supported.
              . Enclose by quotation to search &quot;-PSP&quot; itself. (ex) F &quot;-PSP&quot;.
