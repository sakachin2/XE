                            and result is set to.
                            (ex) TC t10-19=t30-39+50-55
                            If no operand at the right of &quot;=&quot; it set the opd1.

                            With datatype for opd2,numeric assignment done
                            and data type conversion may occur.
                            String constant for opd2 is specified by

                         at each start time.
                         coutEQ option is to count 1up for the line

                         If opd1 datatype is &quot;T&quot; opd2 may interval second.
                         If no data type is specified,opd1 compared with
                         opd2 as string case-sensitively.
                         ex) TC 10-13=30-41~50-51

                         If no datatype for both operand,
                         case sensitive string compare is done.

               New sub-total line is insered according to the break.
               Inserting position is optionally specified. If no insert
               position,it is inserted into the break position.
              -Without break-key nor count.
               By placing &quot;=&quot; at the top of opd1 field,

               Insert position option is for the grand total line.

              When operand 1 and operand 2 is not on the different
              file,specify table block using Cut&amp;Paste.
              Operand 1 is fixed by one mode Alt+F7 just after block
              fixed. &quot;TC =&quot; command is alternative.
              Then next,operand 2 is specified one more block specification.
              Calculation is done by TC command without operand column
              specification. For ex, &quot;TC +=&quot;, &quot;TC 1-9=+&quot;.
              Other option,like as data type is specified. For ex,
              &quot;TC t+=t/4-5&quot;.
              This is not used for &quot;=&quot;(Copy) operation.
