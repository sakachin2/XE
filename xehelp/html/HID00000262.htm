                     Word followed by &quot;\n&quot; means end-of-line matching.

                     ex.) &quot;C *= repstr 1 10 all&quot;

                     Regular expression is supported with -g option.
            *       :search same string as previous search command.
                     Use it search changing new-string or direction
                     like as  c * new2 prev, c old2 * etc.
                     * can be used for also replacing string,
                     it mean same replacing string as previous ones.
                     When used with old-string &quot;*ec&quot;(UTF8 translation error search),
                     This new-string means to reset translation error status with code unchanged.
                     As a result, these code are translated to UTF8 if saved.
                     Error code is not reset is write back as it as.
                     ex) &quot;c *ec * all&quot;

                     Ctrl char specified on <a href="HID00000209.htm">.ini</a> Valid_Ctrl_char
                     parameter is inhibitted to input.
                     When replacing from Tab,Tab is replaced after
                     followed padding char is changed to space.
                     When replacing to Tab,old string is replaced to
                     one byte tab char,then following string is shift to
                     the next tab position.So,&quot;c x \t&quot; after &quot;c \t x&quot;
                     dose not back to original status.
            P'pics' :specifies char-class for each byte. See <A href="HID00000282.htm">FINd</A> cmd for special char susch as &quot;.&quot;,&quot;@&quot;.
                     For new-string, following chars have special meaning.
                     Other chars than following 3 chars are used as replacing chars.
                     New-string length hove not to be same as old-string length.

                     &quot;=&quot; : no replace(keep char on old-string)

                          changes &quot;AaBbCc&quot; to &quot;aaBBC.Xy&quot;.
            -g      :specifies old-string is regular expression. See <A href="HID00000282.htm">FINd</A> cmd for regular expression syntax.

            -Use function key(F6/Shift+F6) to execute same change operation.
             Different from Find,it dose not re-change returning to top or
             bottom of file.
             If needed,use F5 to back around, then use F6.
            -Entering operand only and press function key,it start
             search and change(F6) or reverse search and change
             (Shift+F6).Command verb(only abridgement is allowed) also
             can be put on.
            -Tab and its following space is assumed same as space char.
            -Refer <a href="HID00000254.htm">"About word"</a> for how to specify string.
             (To delete word,enter like as CHA xxxx "".)
            -F5(Re-find) after Change is case sensitive.
