How to start.

  (See xelnxe.txt for Linux version,xeaixe.doc for AIX version).      ||~124FR~

  . Melt zip file on a work directory(unzip xe___)                    ||~8123R~
    Default word dir is c:\xe_wd.
  . Move .exe files to any directory specified on the PATH environment
    variable,or set PATH to the work directory.
  . Set name of the work directory to environment variable.
      Set as following in config.sys(OS/2)/autoexec.bat(DOS or Windows)
      or command file(.cmd/.bat) you created to start xe.
      ex.  xe=d:\xe010
  . Enter xe [file-name] to start this editor.
      "xe /?" help you about command line parameter.
  . XE___.DMP is written to work directory when internal err detected
    (DOS version) or when xe is ABENDed(OS/2,WIN,DJGPP version).
    I'll be very happy if you could send the file by mail when dumped.

         wxe support both,but gxe support support VK_SCROLL type only.
         Keyboard message type dose not generate VK_SCROLL when already
         ScrollLock is on,so that shifts 1 column under that condition.
        .To scroll horizontally using simple wheel mouse,use Shift+wheel.
         Ctrl+wheel is used to jump to top/last page of file.
         These two function is supported also by Linux console version.
       -(WXE)Forward/Backword button click of 5 button mouse is treated
        as DPU/DPD(FilePath Up/Down) command.
       -LOCate cmd.
        .search labeled line by .label operand spcification.
       -Fix keyboad input to uppercase.
        .New command CAP.
          CAP [ON|OFF] [TSO|DEFAULT|CMD]
          Default is set for each TSO file and the others.
          If operand missing on file opened panel,toggles the status of the file.
          CMD means that CAP-ON is effective also on the command-input-line.
        .Use Shift-key when input lowercase letter when CAP ON.
         (Linux console version cannot detect Shift-key,so CAP-ON reverse
          upper and lower. The effect is not same as other version when
          keyboard CapsLock is on)
        .New CAP option of EDIt command set CAP ON status at open.
        .New edit line command "U" support upper-case translation.
          Ur,b.s or UU-UU,b.s format.
       -Setup "Line Drawing Character" by the ini file.
        .As a default,some code are assigned for line drawing character.
         Those are of Japanese DOS under Japanese environment.
         Or else,ECS(IBM PC Extended Character Set) is used as known as CP437.
         Hex code is displayed on =0.2 panel.
        .Code assignment is changed by the file on work directory.
         Naming convention is xelch__.ini[.locale]
           __ : version ID ex) win,gcc,wxe,lnx,gtk.
           locale: for Linux version (lnx and gtk) only.  ex) "ja_JP.eucJP"
                   It is gotten by Linux "locale" command.
           The filename is displayed on the bottom line of =0.2 panel.
        .OPT LINECH [on |off |filename | reload]
       -SUBmit command.
        .Support input redirect specification("<stdinfile").
         To avoid hung by unexpected stdin read operation issued by
         submitted shell/exe, "<NUL"(/dev/null for UNX) is appended
         in those case.
        .For 1st operand(script/exe filename),to make use of PTH
         environment variable fullpath conversion is applyed only
         when path is partialy specified.
         Special path specification format *\ , ^*\ , :: is available.
        .For 2st parameter only,support "*" specification.
         That is replaced by currently opened file name.              ||~124FR~
         ex) "SUB subtool *".
         ("*" of 1st operand means execution of the current file.)
         This is for the convenience of passing file to other script/exe.
         If the file is updated by edit operation,the contents are
         save to a temporary file and the temporary file name is passed
         to the 1st operand file. This is for the convenience of
         repeated submit with partialy modification.
        .Treat "**" as orginal filename specification regardless of   ||~124FR~
         update of the file.
         ex) "SUB subtool * ** p1" , "SUB ** p1"
        .Function key is assignable by ini file.
       -(Win) Turnkey MVS support.
        "Turnkey MVS" is MVSR38J on PC("Hercules" emulates 370 instruction).
        It is able to access TSO file on Turnkey MVS using IND$FILE
        through 3270 emulator.
        It is supported to display PDS members.
        About detail,see the session "Turnkey MVS support" in the chapter
        "(0)Introduction-(D)How to for".                              ||~124FR~
       -Edit command
        .New option Fn[-m] to force the record length to n and set
         left margin to m.
        .New TC|NOTC option to specify TAB clear(change to space at save).
       -B2A/A2B(EBCDIC<==>ASCII) conversion option is added.
        (Ignore 0x0e/0x0f as SO/SI of SBCS(Japanese DBCS))            ||~124FR~
       -Change command.
        IC(CaseInsensitive) and ICN(CaseInSensitive,change displayed line only)
        commands are added.

     3.Miscellaneous.
       -INI command skip Japanese comment output on ini file
       -For delete edit-line-command only,remove limit of repeat count 9999.
       -Reset edit line command differently for label and the other cmds.
        Esc key twice or "RESet" clear line cmd except label,
        Esc key three times or "RESet L" clear label cmd.
       -Assign also Alt+'=' to Vertical-Line as same as Alt+'^'.
        '=' on english 101 keyboard correspond to '^' on 106
        Japanese keyboard.                                            ||~124FR~
       -Separately save scroll value for the parameter setting(=0.1/2/3) panel.
       -On the screen of =0.2 command verb can be cahnged for the function
        for which function-key cannot be assigned except Edit/Browse/Select.
       -Windows Vista support.(Test by RC1 English version)
        .Correspond memory management logic change.
         (xe terminate with msg "address xxxx is not malloced")
        .WinHelp is deprecated.
         Changed to call associated application(browser:IE) and
         to call HtmlHelp for popup help.
         (Previously wxe.hlp was not able to read under English environment)
        .Default charset is changed to use windows default.
         Previously default was ShiftJIS(for Japanese user).          ||~124FR~
       -(WIN/LNX)Also console version,help command kicks browser.
       -Keep old SPF version number on the line number field of valid
        SPF line even when the line was changed by RENUM command.
        Previously renum-ed lines of error SPF file(contains short or ||~124FR~
        invalid line number line) ware changed it version number to
        the largest one.
