There are 2 executable gxe(GTK version)                               ||~v127R~
and xe(work on Terminal emulator such as gnome-terminal,konsole or xterm OR full screen console).||~v127R~
In the following section "#ifdef XXE" means that is description for gxe only.

(1) How to start.

(1-A) Installation from source package

  .Melt gxe-v.rr.tar.gz file on PC(v.rr:version). ex) "tar -xvzf gxe-1.23.tar.gz".
    In the top directory expanded,
      ./configure        (generate Makefile)
      make               (compile & link)
        (See README in the top dir for installation troubles)
      directory structure is as following.
        topdir--README
               +src-                           gxe,gxeDebug
                   +--xe                       xe,xeDebug,xe3270,xe3270Debug
                   +--xsub                     command line tools such as xfc.
                   +--xp                       xprint
                   +--sample
               +--doc-
                   +--en                       flat file document(English)
                   +--jp                       flat file document(Japanese,SJIS and EUC)
                   +--xehelp                   Html documents used by help command and help menu selection.
                                               Icon image wxe.png is here.
      (See also (2) about doc files)
  .You can install some objects including wxe.png to the default directory using "make install".
    (root permission is required)
     gxe,xe,xprint,xfc -->/usr/local/bin                     (this can be changed by --bindir option for make)
     xehelp            -->/usr/local/share/gnome/help/gxe    (packagehelpdir variable of configure.in)
     wxe.png           -->/usr/local/share/pixmaps/gxe
     move binaries what you want to the directory on the PATH.
     xxxDebug is binary compiled with -g option.
     Install other executable manualy such as tool in xsub directory.

(1-B) Installation from binary package

        (src package only from v1.27.)                                ||~v127R~

(1-C) Execution.

#ifdef XXE

   Enter "gxe [filename]" on terminal emulator.
   Or, create shortcut icon on desktop using wxe.png.                 ||~v124R~

#else

  .Start xe by "xe [filename]".

   Command line parm is displayed by "xe --h"(help only for Linux)
   or "xe -h"(common help).

  (Note)-xe works in console mode(run-level=3) and on terminal emulator
         on X(run-level=5).
         Use Ctrl+Alt+Fn(n:1-->6) to switch to console n.
         Console that startx is issued is not avail,usualy it is
         console 1.
         Use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch back to X.
         Unlike console mode,terminal emulator's key-binding is limited.
         To utilize more function key on terminal emulator,
         X setup such as key-binding is required.
         See (4) for setup X, (5) for mouse operation.

        -When use xe on puTTY(**), use puTTY with patch to enable key remapping.
         There is no need to set X environment and to consider what type of terminal emulator
         on which xe works.
         (**) puTTY:free open source telnet client program by Mr. Simon Tatham.
              My patch is to enable general key remapping for xe to utilize
              all shift modifier key conbination.
              Download puttykm.tgz from //www.geocities.jp/sakachin2/index.htm.
              It may be more convenient to run xe on puTTY localy
              than on terminal emulator directly such as gnome-teminal
              with xelnxkey.xxx.
              See also description in (6)Sample file-(i)puTTY.xekeymap.
#endif

  (Note)-Work directory xe_wdnnnnn and xe_undel_nnnnn(nnnnn:UserID)
         are created in ~/(HOME) or /tmp if HOME is / (root).
         Work directory is set to any name if you need ,specifying it
         by env-variable(export xe=xxxx) or -wxxx command line parameter.
         Or env-variable(export xe_undel=xxxx for undo linecmd on dir-
         list.

        -Under KDE environment,start may fail by "error loading shared libraries:..."
         for libgnomevfs, libnomeprint etc.(Case of binary package installation)
         To fix this error,install another gnome application using installer.
         For Kubuntu 6.10,I installed "GNU paint" and "Glade" using "Adept installer"
         with "Any suite" selected.

        -When xe or gxe is hunged.
         Kill the process on the console mode screen.
         X mode is changed to console mode by Ctl+Alt+Fn(n is from 2 to 6),
         and use Ctl+Alt+F7 to back to X mode.
         To kill process,get processId by
           ps -ef|grep xe
         Then enter kill command.(nnnn is processId)
           kill -9 nnnn

        -Adjustment of keyboard rate.
         For Console mode,set "kbdrate -r 6 -d 250" in /etc/rc.local.
         (6:characters per second when repeat. 250:wait 250ms to generate repeated char)
         For X(gterm etc),Open keyboard rate panel by Desktop->Personal->Keyboard.
         Adjust cps and delay parameter testing on TextBox bellow.

        -If WindowManager reacts to the key operation or if xe dose not react,
         adjust system defined shortcut keys and xe key assignments.
         Especially many short cut keys are defined on Kubuntu edgy.  ||~v124R~
         To change shortcut key definition,
         System->Preference->keyboard shortcut for FC5,
         SystemSettings->Computer Administrations->Keyboard & Mouse->keyboard shortcuts for Kubuntu edgy.
         for openSUSE10:
           Configure Desktop Personal Settings->Regional & Accessibility
           ->keyboard Shortcuts.
           F12 popup Kerry Beagle Search as default.
           To disable F12,push "Open configuration dialog".           ||~v124R~
           Select "Show Search Dialog" then push "Custom" radio button.
           Reboot is required.

(3). Difference between Linux Console and other version.

     Before explaining difference between Linux version and others,
     I'll show,you may know, some difference between UNIX and DOS
     which I found in porting work.

  - FileName.
    . No DriveID under UNIX.
    . Directory separator is "/". It is "\" under DOS.
    . Case sensitive filename. Command name is usualy by lower case.
    . "." and ".." is allowed as filename char.
      Bash(Linux shell) interpret "!" and it should not be used.
    . "*" and "?" is allowed as filename char,but shell expand it.
      Command "rm *" to delete filename * will delete all member.
    . "~" means home directory.
    . Wildcard "*.*" dose not match to filename embedding no ".".
  - File operation.
    . 0x1a(Ctrl+z) is not EndOfFile ID.(it can be read beyond EOFID).
    . File and Dir has permission.
        And,when a dir has t-bit on it is protected from rename/unlink
        by other than root or owner.
        Files in a dir with x-bit off is not shown.
        Permission setting of mkdir is controled by umask setting.
        So another chmod may required.
        Permission of file on DOS partition mounted cannot be changed.
    . File timestamp unit is second.(Dos is by 2 seconds).
    . Cd command without operand means cd ~(change to home dir).
#ifdef XXE
      (following about keyboard are irrelevant to gxe)
#else
  - Keyboard.
    . DOS feedback pair of scancode/charcode,UNIX translate keycode
      and returns Escape seq string for extended key like as F1,Ins...
      (Under X, another translation is done,but terminal emulator like as
      xterm generate Esc string corresponding to the X key event.)
      For ex, \x1b[2~ by Insert key.

      Following description is for Fullscreen Console mode only. See (4) for X mode(on Terminal Emulator).||~v124R~||~v127R~

      Strings are set on Terminfo Database(/usr/lib/terminfo) determined
      by TERM env-var,but it shows just how program like as shell pgm
      understand those strings. Key and string mapping is set by      ||~v124R~
      loadkeys cmd. Mapping file is in /usr/lib/kbd/keytables.
      Usualy key generate the string defined on Terminfo.
      Loadkeys cmd may be used to change this mapping.                ||~v124R~
    . Mapping file identify left and right Alt key.
    . "dumpkeys" cmd shows current mapping.
      Output of dumpkeys is also used for input of loadkeys.
      Sample output format of dumpkeys is as following.
      (It is my understanding and it may have error)

       1) keymaps 0-2,4-6,8-9,12
       2) alt_is_meta
       3) keycode   1 = Escape           F83
       4)     control keycode   1 = F84
       5)     shift   alt keycode   1 = Meta_Escape
       6)     keycode  60 = F2               F14              Console_14       F2
       7)     alt      keycode  60 = Console_2
       8)     control   alt keycode  60 = Console_2
              :
              :
              :
       9) string F1 = "\033[[A"
          string F2 = "\033[[B"
          string F3 = "\033[[C"
              :
       1) Mapping index.
          It specify correspondance of each columns with shift key.
          Each digit is constructed with 0:Normal,1:Shift,2:AltGR(Alt-R),
          4:Ctrl,8:Alt(Alt-L),16:Shift-L,32:Shift-R,64:Ctrl-L,128:Ctrl-R.
          Sample line specify column left of "=" is sequecialy        ||~v124R~
          Normal(0),Shift(1),AltGR(2),Ctrl(4),Shift+Ctrl(5),AltGR+Ctrl(6),
          Alt(8),Shift+Alt(9),Ctrl+Alt(12) each.
       2) Alt+x(char key) generate Meta-x char.
          Meta-x is determined by setmetamode setting.
          That is Esc+x or 0x80|x. For example,Alt+a is 0x1b61 or 0xe1.
       3) This is Function name assigned to a keycode.
          Keycode value is shown by showkey cmd.
          This example is that keycode 1 is for Escape and for F83
          with Shift+. F83's meaning is determined by each application.
          Mapping file can only define strings generated by the key
          combination. 9) is sample string definition.
       4),5),7),8)
          Another format of Shift key combination.
       6) F14 is assigned to Shift+F2. AltGR+F2 is for Console14,
          but max number of console supported is limitted.
       7) Alt(Alt-L)+F2 is assigned to console2,that is,Alt+F2 switch
          screen to another console.
       9) Strings are defined for each Fxx.

    . Combination with Alt key is sometimes intercepted by operating
      system itself or shell.

    . xe,at the initialization,assigns strings to functions using API
      like as loadkey command do.
      Esc string assingnment is allowed only for Fnn key.
      xe assign Fnn to key combination(Shift/Ctrl/Alt) which is used by xe.
      String assigned to Fnn is set to xe format which is constructed by
      scancode, charcode and modifier key ID, that is \x1B~+scancode+charcoe+shiftid.
      See (9)-(a) for mapping of key combination and scan+char code.

      ex) F48 is assigned to Alt+F12 with \x1b~8C003.
          F48 is function name assigned by xe to Alt+keycode 88.
          \x1b~ is id of string by xe. 8C00 is scancode+charcode for Alt+F12
          defined on PCDOS.
          Shift id is 0:No shift, 1:Shift+, 2:Ctrl+, 3:Alt+.          ||~v124R~
      These are set also by Linux command "loadkeys".
      Under kon(Kanji ON console),assign API is not avail.
      So use "loadkeys xej106.map" for xe before enter to kon.
      For compatibility with other application,strings defined on
      terminfo is not changed and accepted.
      For ex,"^[[[A" is usualy assinged to F1 by terminfo library
      (/usr/lib/terminfo/l/linux), and xe accept it.
      See (9)-(b) for default translation accepted by xe.             ||~v124R~
#endif

  - Screen.
#ifdef XXE
    . gxe allow background color change by color-dialog from Setup pulldown
      menu. Foreground colors are changed by gxe option 0 on top menu.
#else
    . curses routine support color control.
      Linux may not support background highlight.
    . There is no method to change cursor shape in curses library.
#endif
  - Other miscellaneous.
    . Use "-" as command flag parameter(DOS use "/"),                 ||~v124R~
      and allow parm with value,for ex,by both "-o fnm1" and "-ofnm1" fmt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

     So,there are following difference.

  - FileName.
    . Change to "_" from "!" which is used for the file internaly used.
    . File or directory which name contains "*" or "?" is not processed.
    . Issue confirmation when filename is "*",
      It may be misunderstanding of current file.
      ("xprint *" means print current displayed file.)
  - File operation.
    . CD with no operand set to home directory.
    . Display EOFID(0x1a:Ctrl+z) on last of file under textmode also.
      0x1a(Ctrl+z) is not a input inhibit char.
      So,INI file cannot be share between Linux version and others.
      (To get default INI file,Enter ini cmd after starting by "xe -i").
    . WorkDir and UndoSaveDir for undo of dir list cmd is created
      for each user. There is no need of XE environment variable.
    . Chmod command is added.
        New option of mkdir to specify permission is added.
        Attribute specification is changed to permission specification
        for attr DOS command/line command on dirlist.
        s-bit(Setuid/Setgid) and t-bit(Sticky) can be set.            ||~v124R~
        Mode parameter format is oooo or oooxx.
        For oooo format,first "o" is setuid(4),setgid(2),sticky(1).
        And last 3 "o" is for usual permision,owner,group and others.
        For oooxx format,ooo is usual permission, xx is sSgt.
        u:setuid, S:setuid+setgid, g:setgid, t:sticky.                ||~v124R~
        See help msg by attr command with no operand.
        Permission of files in DOS partition mounted is not changed.
        Filename case(lower/upper) changeing is not allowed also for
        the files in the DOS partition.

  - Keyboard.
#ifdef XXE
    . Left-Alt and Right-Alt key is same effect.
#else
    . Use Left-Alt key for Alt key combinations.
      Combination of Right-Alt key and char key is not defined.       ||~v124R~
    . String genenated by a key and its translation by xe is checked
      by xekbchk utulity.
#endif
  - Screen.
#ifdef XXE
#else
    . 8 colors and mono-color are supported.

    line once without DBCS and next write DBCS only.
    DBCS mode is kon(Console mode) and terminal emulator except
    xterm(X mode).
    Default is
    "Clear whole screen at full screen re-write case(ex. PgUp) if
    screen is not splitted. Else draw DBCS line twice".
    Following option modifies default.
    "--c":Clear all line at full screen write even if screen is splitted.
          Another screen may flicker for old CPUs.
    "--d":Draw updated lines only,no whole line clear.

     Terminal emulator such as xterm/kterm generate strings alternatively.
     But it is not sufficient for xe,you need to add key and modifier key||~v124R~
     (Shift/Ctrl/Alt) combination as Xresource definition.
     Merge sample xelnxres.xxx file(xxx:distributionID) to Xresource
     using xrdb command.
     Application name in the X-resource file is "xe" to avoid
     intervention with other appl on xterm/kterm.
     So,it is required to notify to terminal emulator.
     ex) "kterm -name xe -e xe"
         -name is application name and -e is command name.
         xe of "-name xe" is corresponding to xe in X-resource file.  ||~v124R~

           xe*cursorColor: blue
           xe*vt100.Translations:  #override \n\
               Shift<Key>F1:   string(0x1b)    string("~54001")\n\
               :
               :
     Starting shell is like as following.
        xrdb -merge /g/src/xe/xelnxres.xxx
        kterm -name xe -e xe $1 $2 $3
     ==>See sample sell xegt/xekt/xext in (6).

     To setup environment without intervention,following is another   ||~v124R~
     method.
     Create copy of command file kterm. ex)cp kterm ktermxe.
     Prepare X-resource file with appliaction name is of copied file.
     Start xe on the copied kterm command name.
     Copyed filename should have original command name string in the name,
     because xe determines terminal emulator from command name of the ||~v124R~
     parent process.

     If intervention is not a problem,you can specify
     application class name in the resource file.
     ex) KTerm*vt100.Translations ...
     KTerm is class name,so all application under kterm is effected.
     In this case X-environment for xe may be setup as following.
     Add following line to $HOME/.bashrc.

        if [ -f /local/etc/xelnxres.xxx ]; then
	        xrdb -merge /local/etc/xelnxres.xxx
        fi

     "xekbchk -sfnm" write default string which is accepted by xe.
     Those are shared with other application.
     See (9)-(b) for xe default.

                                                                      ||~v124R~

     These are not for gnome-terminal which dose not chk X resource.
     F1 is assigned for help as default,set disable it on the menu    ||~v124R~
     Edit-->keybindings.
     And disable assignment of F10 to menu short cut.
     Shift+F10 is intercepted by gnome-terminal of FedoraCore4.
     This may not be remapped because it seems to me that is GTK default.
     And gnome-terminal depends on vte.
     vte fixes some key combination,such as Shift+Insert to paste clipboard-PRINMARY.||~v124R~
     Shift+PgUp/PgDn/Home/End are also fixed.(see vte.c of vte SRPM)
     To work around these use xmodmap reasignment.

     Mapping file is /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/*.map.
     For the case your setting is to use the other mapping file,
     save your mapping at first login after reboot using,for ex,

    (d)xelnxres.xxx
       X resource file for xterm,kterm.
       xe requires more key combination over default shown at (9)-(b).
       This file setup to generate Esc string correspond to key combination
       which xe use.
       Set up like as "xrdb -merge xnlsres.xxx".(See also xekt,xext)
       String "xext" and "xekt" is application  name which correspond to
       -name option of xterm,kterm command.
       For ex., xterm started by "xterm -name xext" command is effected
       X resource definition in the line "xext*...".
       These are not for gnome-terminal which dose not chk X resource.

       All key definition xe use as default is showed in xelnxres.full.
       Copy the line from it to your X resource file.
       Format of Esc string for xe is following.
          0x1b~xxyyz   xx:DOS-Scan Code yy:DOS-Char Code
                       z:Shift ID  0:No shift  , 1:Shift+
                                   2:Ctrl+       3:Alt+
          See (9)-(a) for DOS Scan/Char code.
       You may change fg,bg and cursor color.
       It is required for kterm to set EightBitInput:true to accept DBCS input.

       X key binding file.
       To change X key binding enter like as "xmodmap xexmap.xxx".
       gnome-terminal dose not check X resource db,so use xmodmap
       to benefit more key combination.
       ex)     "keysym Insert    = Insert    F20"
       This sample is to bind Insert key to the function Insert(w/o Shift key)
       and F20(with Shift key).
       Esc string F20 generates is translated by xelnxkey.xxx.        ||~v127R~
       Available Fxx is F13-F20.
       String generated by Fxx is gotten by xekbchk utility.
       For ex.,F20 generate string "0x1b[34:2~" under RedHat v9.

       To use Right-Ctrl as execute key,include the following line.
       This changes R-Ctrl to work as Execute but dose no change Enter to work as New-Line.||~v127I~
         keycode 109 = Return

 (Note)Ctrl+CharKey may be used as function key by OPT CCFUNC cmd.
       If you use those key,this file may not be used. See (5)Restriction.

       xext/xekt/xegt starts xe under xterm/kterm/gnome-terminal each.
       Setup for X mode is done once after boot.
       So,use native command when you changed X resource file.        ||~v124R~
       For X resource for kterm/xterm,
       enter "xrdb -merge res-filename",then restart terminal emulator.
       For key binding for gnome-terminal,
       enter "xmodmap modmapfile",then restart terminal emulator.

       Usage:                                                         ||~v124R~

       For ex., "xext pgm=xekbchk" start xekbchk after setup xterm for xe.
       "xext pgm=" means start of xterm only.
       You may split this shell function to start of terminal emulator
       and start of xe.
       Use xlsfonts to check valid font size for xekt.
       Screen is corrupted if font size of SBCS and DBCS is mismatched.

        There may be no need to use this patch because puTTY v0.63 terminal type:SCO supports||~v127R~
        almost modifier-function key combination required for xe.     ||~v127R~
                                                                      ||~v127R~
        [puTTY] section is for puTTY. [common] sestion is for both xe and puTTY.
        Use --k parameter to notify keymapping to xe.
        Select suitable(best match with other application run on the same puTTY session)
        esc string from "(9)Tables-(b) Default Esc string translation of xe"
        The "^[~xxyyz" (DOS scan+char+shiftid) format is for xe only and there is no need
        to define in [common] section.
        The line "KeyString:C+H         =^[~23082" is the sample of that format.
        puTTY send the string 0x1b~23082 by Ctrl+H key-press and xe understand it as Ctrl+H.
        On the other hand,when xe run on terminal emulator same string x08 as backSpace||~v124R~
        is generated. xe do backspace by Ctrl+H.
        Run xekbchk to check string puTTY send.
        xekbchk accept also --k parameter.

    (j) xe.keytab

      (Case of Kubuntu6)

        To generate Esc-string which xe can understand under konsole terminal emulator,
        put,for ex,XE.keytab on ~/.kde/share/apps/konsole/.
        (or /usr/share/apps/konsele/ for global definition)
        Then select it from the list of Settings->Keyboard.           ||~v124R~
        Name on the list is from the keyboard statement of the .keytab file.
        To set default keytab, open Settings->Configure Konsole.
        On session tab,after selecting "Shell" line select from keytab drop-down list.
        To test your keytab file syntax, enter "konsole --keytab XE".
        The id "XE" is also from the  keyboard statement.
        Verification is done when menu item Settings is selected.

        You should remove duplicated shortcut key definition on konsole
        and global settion to utilize those keys.
        Konsole shortcut is defined on Settings->Configure Shortcuts.
        Global shortcut is customized on SystemSettings->Computer Administration
        ->Keyboard & Mouse->Keyboard Shortcuts.
        Search(grep -irl) also in the dir ~/.kde/share/config.
        for ex,[Voice] section may define shortcut=Shift+f12
        on ~/.kde/share/config/khotkeysrc.
        This correspond to SystemSettings->Accessibility.
        Select InputActions of left column and  push Global Settings.
        Voice setting tab shows Shift+F12. After reset it to none.
        Shift+F12 setting of keytab file will work.

        (note)./usr/share/doc/konsole/README.KeyTab may help you to coding
               keytab file.
              .Both "-Modifier" and "+Modifier" definition is required
               if you use the key with and without the Modifier.
               else "already assigned" error message issued when you test
               using "konsole --keytab xxx.keytab".
              ."*" on esc string is replaced by 2:Shift,3:Alt,5:Control ecah for the line with +AnyMod.
